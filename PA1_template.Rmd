## Loading and preprocessing the data
```{r, echo=TRUE}
activity <- read.csv("activity.csv")
```

## What is mean total number of steps taken per day?
```{r, echo=TRUE}
summary_activity <- aggregate(steps ~ date, data=activity, FUN=sum)
hist(as.numeric(summary_activity$steps))

sum(summary_activity$steps)
mean(summary_activity$steps)
median(summary_activity$steps)
```


## What is the average daily activity pattern?
# For this I'll take the mean of the daily steps grouped by each interval, across all days
```{r, echo=TRUE}
daily <- aggregate(steps ~ interval, data=activity, FUN=mean)
plot(daily$interval, daily$steps, type="l")

# Interval with most activity across all days, on average
subset(daily, daily$steps == max(daily$steps))
```

## Imputing missing values
```{r, echo=TRUE}
missing_intervals <- subset(activity, is.na(activity$steps))

# Number of intervals with missing steps
length(missing_intervals$steps)

# Impute missing values

```

## Are there differences in activity patterns between weekdays and weekends?
